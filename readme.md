### pre-release - not ready for use
# tssql

- `tssql` is a well typed query builder, covering a small subset of sql.
- The priority is on type-safety over feature-parity with sql dialects.

Roadmap:
- [x] Query interface
- [ ] sql server specific syntax
- [ ] postgres specific syntax
- [ ] generate schema type from sql server
- [ ] generate sql server types
- [ ] generate clients
